# Lecture notes 'Betriebssysteme'
📓 This repository contains lecture notes for the fourth semester lecture 'Betriebssysteme' at the Cooperative State University Mannheim.

🔗 The summary was created using Obsidian and works best with it. The linking between pages is Obsidian-specific and possibly won't work with other tools.
This [repository](https://github.com/LCHXYZ/dhbw_semester-04_betriebssysteme) is a fork of this one, but with standard Markdown links.

❓ The lecture notes are not specifically a summary of the lecture, but are questions to ask yourself while studying. This follows the research of 'Active Recall', which is scientifically proven to be the most effective way of studying.

🧑‍🎓 To start studying with this repository, open the note [[_Betriebssysteme]]. From here all other notes are linked and you can jump in between the topics sorted by the week it was introduced during the lecture.

☺ Enjoy!
